# project_timer
This is a simple terminal app where you can control your work time. It saves a .csv file with your work time and pause time, but it saves in timestamp, to make it easily to handle, but you have access to the .csv file and can see your pause and work time.

Use:

-n project_name to create a new project

-t project_name to see the time you are currently working on this project

-p project_name to add a pause time

-r project_name to create a new work time and start to count your worked time from here
